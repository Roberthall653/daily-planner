This project was largely a demonstration of jquery and subsequent DOM manipulation. I used dayjs to grab times and days that can be displayed or used as comparative data for formatting. Once the page was formatted to color-code based on time, I worked on grabbing text from each text area, saving it to local storage, and using the hour id to keep them displayed in the box they were created in.
